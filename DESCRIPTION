Description: Read and analyze kinematic data recorded from a Carstens
  AG501 electromagnetic articulograph (EMA). Metadata and positional data
  (x-, y-, and z-dimensions, and rotation) recorded from EMA sensors are
  structured as a nested data frame. Functions are provided for filtering
  positional data (e.g., low-pass Butterworth filter) or for calculating derived
  time-series (e.g., velocity or acceleration profiles from either forward or
  central differencing).

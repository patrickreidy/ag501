Description: Analyze kinematic data recorded from a Carstens AG501 
    electromagnetic articulograph (EMA). Metadata and positional data recorded 
    from EMA sensors are structured as a nested data frame. Functions provided
    for filtering data (e.g., low-pass Butterworth filter) or for calculating
    derived time-series from the position data (e.g., velocity or acceleration
    from forward or central differencing) are defined with data-first argument
    lists, making them compatible with the tidyverse.
